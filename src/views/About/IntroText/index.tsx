                    Qber is an online platform funded by the Centre for Disease Control
                    Foundation (DCDF) that aims at improving the quality of multi sectoral
                    needs assessments in humanitarian crises.
                </b>
                &thinsp;It offers an interactive and user-friendly way to quickly design
                and generate a questionnaire in emergencies, using pre-validated questions
                tailored for Key Informant Interviews and Direct Observation. Questions
                proposed in Qber have been identified based on a thorough review of a hundred
                multi sectoral need assessments in emergencies and discussions with global
                sector experts. Future iterations will include household level questions.

                    Qber’s questions have been designed and categorized to fit within a
                    predefined analysis framework
                </b>
                &thinsp; available below, composed of pillars (e.g. Context, Displacement,
                humanitarian access, etc.) and sub pillars (e.g. displacement/intentions,
                displacement/pull factors, etc.). The Qber Analysis Framework was designed
                after a review and analysis of 50 different frameworks. It is a guide for
                data collection and analysis and represents the different dimensions that
                are commonly measured during a humanitarian emergency to understand the
                operational environment within which humanitarian actors and the affected
                population interact, as well as unmet needs. For each pillar and sub pillar
                of the framework, a set of questions is proposed for use in Qber. Try it!
                Click on any sub pillar in the framework image below and you will see
                questions appearing on the right side.

                    We designed Qber so the questionnaire design process in humanitarian
                    emergencies is faster and more efficient.

                &thinsp;In Qber, you can create projects for your needs assessment, and each
                project may contain several questionnaires, e.g. a Key Informant Interview form
                and a Direct Observation form. Follow the guided process in Qber and select what
                you want to assess, organize the structure of your questionnaire, select your
                questions from the menu of preloaded questions in Qber or add new ones if you
                don’t find what you are looking for in the existing list. You can also filter
                questions based on the experience of your enumerators or the type of crisis
                you are in. Finally you will be able to export your questionnaire either in
                an XLS form for use in Kobo Toolbox or print the questionnaire on paper.

                We are constantly trying to improve the set of questions in Qber. Feel free to
                reach out to us if you want to suggest additional questions or modify existing
                ones! We wish you the best for your needs assessment!
